## Jets Project

## Overview:
This project definitely tested all of the material we have just learned in the last three weeks. Seeing all of the material we have learned come together in this project...definitely had its highs and lows. It taught me more on how to write UML and how important it is to have organized code. I really enjoyed the challenge this project presented and had fun writing it!

## How to operate the Jets Application:
First, the user will be prompted with a menu of options they can select from in the Jets Application:
    - [1] LIST THE FLEET OF JETS
    - [2] FLY ALL OF THE JETS
    - [3] VIEW THE FASTEST JET
    - [4] VIEW THE JET WITH THE LONGEST RANGE
    - [5] LOAD ALL OF THE CARGO JETS
    - [6] LET'S HAVE A DOGFIGHT !!
    - [7] ADD A JET TO THE FLEET
    - [8] REMOVE A JET FROM THE FLEET
    - [9] QUIT

Second, if the user selects option 1 - it will print out the list of all of the jets in the fleet with the model, speed, range and price.

Third, if the user selects option 2 - it will print out the jets to fly with a funny message for each one.

Fourth, if the user selects option 3 - it will print out the fastest jet in the fleet.

Fifth, if the user selects option 4 - it will print out the longest range jet in the fleet.

Sixth, if the user selects option 5 - it will print out the cargo jets that are loaded with a message.

Seventh, if the user selects option 6 - it will print out the fighterJets having a DogFight with a message.

Eight, if the user selects option 7 - it will prompt the user with a menu to have them add a jet to the fleet. It will ask them what type of jet they would like to add, model, speed, range, and price of the jet. Once they complete this it will display the new jet they have just added to the fleet. If they select option 1 again it will display the fleet of jets with their new jet added.

Ninth, if the user selects option 8 - it will prompt the user with the display of the list of all of the jets in the feet with a number associated with each jet. It will then display a message asking the user which number jet would they like to remove from the fleet. They will select the corresponding number and press enter. When they select option 1 again it will list the fleet of jets and see the one they have removed.

Tenth, if the user selects option 9 - to quit the program, the user will be prompted with a message letting them know they have exited the program.

** Should the user select an invalid number on the user menu prompt, it will display a funny message letting them know they have selected an incorrect option.
